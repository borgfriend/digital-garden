In the movie the chef there is only one actually edible meal - the classic cheeseburger.

## Ingredients

* 2 Burger Buns
* 300g ground beef
* 8 slices of cheese
* 1 onion
* Salt + Pepper

* Frozen French Fries

## Preparation

1. Put the French Fries into the oven
2. Cut the onion into thin slices.
4. Divide the ground meat into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball.
5. Toast the burger buns in a pan over medium heat until they are lightly browned.
6. Remove the burger buns from the pan and set them aside.
7. Add some oil to the same pan and heat it over medium-high heat. Place the meat balls into the pan and use a spatula to smash them into thin patties. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until the patties are browned and cooked through.
8. While the patties are cooking, sprinkle a generous amount of salt and pepper on top of each patty.
9. Place the sliced onions on top of each patty and use the spatula to smash the onions into the patty. Flip the patty.
