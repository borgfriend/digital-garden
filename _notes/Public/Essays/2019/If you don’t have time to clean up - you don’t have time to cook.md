Over the past two months, I have been contemplating this simple yet intriguing sentence. It seems so trivial that it borders on meaningless, but its truth cannot be denied.

**Professionals think about all facets of the project, pull through the fun and the boring parts, and finish it correctly.**

What I find fascinating is that Seth Godin, a renowned bestselling author on business-related topics, wrote this sentence in one of his blog posts. In his blog post gave it minimal context to say professionals use this same type of thinking when approaching their own projects. - The fact alone that he wrote this sentence elevated the sentence and gave it an additional value.

If Jamie Oliver, a renowned chef, uttered the same phrase, I would have ignored it and focused instead on the delicious meal he prepared. I wouldn't have considered the philosophical implications this could have on my career.

This simple sentence has made me aware of how I read certain authors and how I change focus depending on the author / the subject that I am reading.  It also helped me to stop seeing the tedious and enjoyable aspects of a task as two separate tasks. Ensuring that I actually pull through the entire project.
